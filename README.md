# CML_RemoteAccess
You no longer need to use breakout tool, jump servers, console sessions to access your Cisco Modeling Lab (CML). Use this script to make your CML lab accessible remotely from anywhere. The script leverages CML APIs with virl2_client python library to install and configure RADKit service within your existing lab.
